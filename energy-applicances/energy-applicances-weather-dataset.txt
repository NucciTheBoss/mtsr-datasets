Features in the CSV (in order from left to right): 
* Appliances - energy use in Wh 
* Lights - energy use of light fixtures in the house in Wh 
* T1 - Temperature in kitchen area, in Celsius 
* RH_1 - Humidity in kitchen area, in % 
* T2 - Temperature in living room area, in Celsius 
* RH_2 - Humidity in living room area, in % 
* T3 - Temperature in laundry room area 
* RH_3 - Humidity in laundry room area, in % 
* T4 - Temperature in office room, in Celsius 
* RH_4 - Humidity in office room, in % 
* T5 - Temperature in bathroom, in Celsius 
* RH_5 - Humidity in bathroom, in % 
* T6 - Temperature outside the building (north side), in Celsius 
* RH_6 - Humidity outside the building (north side), in % 
* T7 - Temperature in ironing room , in Celsius 
* RH_7 - Humidity in ironing room, in % 
* T8 - Temperature in teenager room 2, in Celsius 
* RH_8 - Humidity in teenager room 2, in % 
* T9 - Temperature in parents room, in Celsius 
* RH_9 - Humidity in parents room, in % 
* To - Temperature outside (from Chievres weather station), in Celsius 
* Pressure (from Chievres weather station), in mm Hg 
* RH_out - Humidity outside (from Chievres weather station), in % 
* Wind speed (from Chievres weather station), in m/s 
* Visibility (from Chievres weather station), in km 
* rv1  Random variable 1, nondimensional 
* rv2 Random variable 2, nondimensional 
* Tdewpoint (from Chievres weather station), in Celsius

Notes: 
* Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters)
* Tdewpoint is the feature to predict
* Dataframe total shape is (19735, 28)
* The local intrinsic estimation value is 9.35095
