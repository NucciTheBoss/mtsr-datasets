3. Past Usage:

Forecasting skewed biased stochastic ozone days: analyses, solutions and beyond, Knowledge and Information Systems, Vol. 14, No. 3, 2008.
Discusses details about the dataset, its use as well as various experiments (both cross-validation and streaming) using many state-of-the-art methods.

A shorter version of the paper (does not contain some detailed experiments as the journal paper above) is in:
Forecasting Skewed Biased Stochastic Ozone Days: Analyses and Solutions. ICDM 2006: 753-764 


4. Relevant Information:

The following are specifications for several most important attributes 
that are highly valued by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). 
More details can be found in the two relevant papers.
 
-- O 3 - Local ozone peak prediction
-- Upwind - Upwind ozone background level
-- EmFactor - Precursor emissions related factor
-- Tmax - Maximum temperature in degrees F
-- Tb - Base temperature where net ozone production begins (50 F)
-- SRd - Solar radiation total for the day
-- WSa - Wind speed near sunrise (using 09-12 UTC forecast mode)
-- WSp - Wind speed mid-day (using 15-21 UTC forecast mode)
