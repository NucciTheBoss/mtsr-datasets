Features in the CSV (in order from left to right): 
* Node number - The number of the nodes in the network. (8x8 or 4x4).
* Thread number - The number of threads in each node at the beginning of the simulation.
* Spatial distribution - The performance of the network is evaluated using synthetic traffic workloads. Uniform (UN), Hot Region (HR), Bit reverse (BR) and Perfect Shuffle (PS) traffic models have been included. I have encoded them into unique integer [0,3] in that order.
* Temporal distribution - Temporal distribution of packet generation is implemented by independent traffic sources. They utilized client server traffic (i.e., a server node sends packets to respond to the reception of packets from clients) and asynchronous traffic (i.e., initially, all nodes generate traffic independently of the others; as time progresses, traffic generation at the source/destination nodes depends on the receipt of messages from destination/source nodes).
* T/R - Message transfer time (T) Uniformly distributed with mean in range from 20 to 100 clock cycles. Thread run time (R) Exponentially distributed with a mean of 100 clock cycles.
* Processor utilization - The average processor utilization measures the percent of time that threads are running in the processor. 
* Channel waiting time - Average waiting time of a packet at the output channel queue until it is serviced by the channel. 
* Input waiting time - Average waiting time of a packet until it is serviced by the processor.
* Channel utilization - The percent of time that the channel is busy transferring packets to the network. 
* Network response time - The time between a request message is enqueued at the output channel and the corresponding data message is received in the input queue.

Notes: 
* Network response time is the feature to predict
* Dataframe total shape is (640, 10)
* The local intrinsic estimation value is 2.7109
