Features in the CSV (in order from left to right): 
* True hourly averaged concentration CO in mg/m^3 (reference analyzer)
* True hourly averaged overall Non Metanic HydroCarbons concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer)
* True hourly averaged Benzene concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer) 
* PT08.S2 (titania) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NMHC targeted)
* True hourly averaged NOx concentration in ppb (reference analyzer)
* PT08.S3 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NOx targeted) 
* True hourly averaged NO2 concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer) 
* PT08.S4 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NO2 targeted)
* PT08.S5 (indium oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally O3 targeted) 
* Temperature in C
